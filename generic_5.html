									     <p>This is an analysis of the gender pay gap in the UK. The dataset was taken from Gov.uk The data is self reported, by all companies with more than 250 employees. Reporting is mandatory for these companies. Different measures of the pay gap must be submitted.</p>

	select*
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	-- 1. How many companies are in the data set?
	select
	count(employerid)
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22;

	-- 2. How many of them submitted their data after the reporting deadline?
	select
	submittedafterthedeadline,
	count(employerid)
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	group by submittedafterthedeadline;
	→ True (361)

	select
	count(companylinktogpginfo)
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	where companylinktogpginfo = '0'
	→ 3700
	-- 4. Which measures of pay gap contain too much missing data, and should not be used in our
	analysis?
	select
	diffmeanhourlypercent
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	where diffmeanhourlypercent is NULL;
	→ No NULLS

	→ 16
	-- 5. Choose which column you will use to calculate the pay gap. Will you use
	DiffMeanHourlyPercent or DiffMedianHourlyPercent? Can you justify your choice?
	DiffMeanHourlyPercent
	Even though the mean can have outliers and can skew the results the median has too many missing
	values to be reliable.
	-- 6. Use an appropriate metric to find the average gender pay gap across all the companies in
	the data set. Did you use the mean or the median as your averaging metric? Can you justify
	your choice?
	select
	avg(diffmeanhourlypercent)
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22;
	→ 13.6350599567525064
	7. What are some caveats we need to be aware of when reporting the figure we’ve just
	calculated?
	→ that there might be outliers and the sample size the results are out of the given data set there might
	not be representative of the population.
	8. What are the 10 companies with the largest pay gaps skewed towards men?
	select
	employername,
	diffmeanhourlypercent
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	where diffmeanhourlypercent >0
	order by diffmeanhourlypercent desc
	limit 10;
	9. What do you notice about the results? Are these well-known companies
	These are male dominant industries.
	Football clubs mostly so yes.
	10. Apply some additional filtering to pick out the most significant companies with large pay
	gaps.
	select
	employername,
	diffmeanhourlypercent,
	responsibleperson,
	employersize,
	malebonuspercent,
	femalebonuspercent
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	where diffmeanhourlypercent >0
	and malebonuspercent>80
	order by diffmeanhourlypercent desc
	limit 10;
	11. How would you report on the results? Can we say that these companies are engaging in
	unlawful pay discrimination?
	We don’t know as the different types of jobs are not specified is all included under the same
	aggregation so we can not know the nuances of seniority and the responsibility of different roles
	within each company.
	12. What’s the average pay gap in London versus outside London?
	select
	avg(diffmeanhourlypercent)
	from gender_pay_gap_21_22
	where address like '%London%'
	;
	→ 15.700486725663717
	13. What’s the average pay gap in London versus Birmingham?
	select

	14. What is the average pay gap within schools?
	SELECT
	avg(diffmeanhourlypercent) AS avg_siccodes,
	CASE

	16. Is there a relationship between the number of employees at a company and the average
	pay gap?
	SELECT
	COUNT(employerid) AS Companies_Count, avg(DiffMeanHourlyPercent) AS
	AVG_DiffMeamHourlyPercent, employersize
